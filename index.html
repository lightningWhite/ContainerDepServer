<h1>File Server</h1>
<p>This file server is intended as an artifact repository for building Dockerfiles/Containerfiles.</p>
<p>To use it, start the nginx server by running start_server.sh, and then use wget to grab the desired file or artifact.</p>
<p>For example: wget localhost:1010/<filename></p>
<p>To add new artifacts, simply place them into the directory where the start_server.sh script is being run.</p>
